### Resources

- `DDL.sql` contains the SQL statements used to define the database schema.
- `items.json` contains the information used to populate the table `items`.

### Dependencies

This project uses SQLite for storing data. It was chosen because it is self-contained, meaning it does not require client-server configuration like MySQL or PostgreSQL. It also makes testing the app's database functions easier for the author. This project also uses JSONSimple for JSON manipulation.
